# rest-api-with-angular-frontend-demo-app

This application allows users to register, login, view, update, delete and add employees to a database.

This app uses an Angular/Typescript frontend and a Spring Boot Java backend. 

I used PostgreSQL for the database, but this can be changed in the application.properties file in the API 'resources' folder. 

To run the application, first you will need to run the API on a server (I used Eclipse IDE and ran as a Java Application). Then run the application frontend (I used VS Code and ran the 'ng serve' command in the terminal).
